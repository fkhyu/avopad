# Avolites Hackpad

This is a compact macropad designed specifically for Avolites lighting consoles. It adds a set of custom cues or quick actions mapped to physical buttons. Ideal for programmers and lighting techs who want a tactile shortcut system for faster cue triggering.

## üéØ Features

- 6-key macropad
- Designed to be plug-and-play with Avolites Titan software
- Compatible with KMK (CircuitPython) firmware
- 3D printed case
- Uses Seeed XIAO RP2040 as MCU

## üõ†Ô∏è Firmware Setup (KMK)

The firmware sends HID keypresses that Avolites software interprets as hotkeys (e.g. custom cue triggers).

KMK and CircuitPython must be installed on the Seeed XIAO RP2040.
